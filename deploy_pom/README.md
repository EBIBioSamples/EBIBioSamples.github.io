# The BioSamples GitHub Repo Deployment POM

This is to be used as a parent POM in your project, when you need to deploy your project in [our organisation's repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EBIBioSamples/EBIBioSamples.github.io/maven-repo). Everything is explained in the [POM's itself](pom.xml).
