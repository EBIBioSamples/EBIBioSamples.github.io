# EBIBioSamples.github.io

As usually this is the place where we keep the organisation web site. Anything you put here, 
in the master branch, is reflected at [http://ebibiosamples.github.io/](http://ebibiosamples.github.io/).

Moreover, we also use this repository as...


# Organisation Maven repository

There is a [special POM project](https://github.com/EBIBioSamples/EBIBioSamples.github.io/tree/master/deploy_pom), 
which you can use to deploy your own projects here. See [instructions directly inside that POM](https://github.com/EBIBioSamples/EBIBioSamples.github.io/blob/master/deploy_pom/pom.xml).
In order to link projects deployed in here, you just need to link the [repo root](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EBIBioSamples/EBIBioSamples.github.io/maven-repo) in your
dependant POM.

Have fun! :-)
